## 📌 Overview

This repository represents a collection of advanced automation, performance engineering, API validation, and chaos engineering platforms built for real-world blockchain and Web2 production systems.

These systems are designed not just to validate functionality — but to simulate real production conditions including load spikes, RPC failures, infrastructure shutdowns, and recovery validation.

The goal is simple:

**Build systems that do not just pass tests — but survive failures.**

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Selenium
- K6 (Performance Testing)
- YAML Configuration
- Docker
- SSH-Based Infrastructure Control
- JSON-RPC
- Google Chat Webhooks

## 🎯 Engineering Philosophy

Traditional QA validates correctness.

This portfolio validates:

- Stability under load  
- Infrastructure resilience  
- Failure recovery behavior  
- Role-based access correctness  
- API consistency across projects  
- Operational observability  

This is automation-first, resilience-focused engineering.

# 🔄 Execution Flow Model

A typical execution follows:

1. Load project configuration  
2. Execute functional API tests  
3. Validate RPC health  
4. Apply ramp-up load  
5. Trigger chaos events (if enabled)  
6. Monitor degradation  
7. Restart affected components  
8. Re-validate system behavior  
9. Generate structured reports  
10. Send alert notifications
