# Automation & Resilience Engineering Portfolio

## Overview

This repository represents a collection of advanced automation, performance engineering, API validation, and chaos engineering platforms built for real-world blockchain and Web2 production systems.

The projects inside this portfolio focus on:

- Multi-project API automation
- RPC validation & regression testing
- Load and ramp-up performance testing
- Role-based Web2 user journey automation
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Google Chat alert integrations
- Chaos engineering & infrastructure resilience validation

Each system is designed to simulate real-world production scenarios and validate system behavior under both normal and failure conditions.

---

## Engineering Philosophy

The goal of these systems is not just to test functionality — but to validate:

- Stability under load  
- Infrastructure resilience  
- Failure recovery behavior  
- Role-based access correctness  
- API consistency across multiple projects  
- Production-level operational visibility  

This portfolio reflects an automation-first and resilience-focused engineering approach.
